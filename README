New and Improved as of 15 May, 2012!
Added a running averaging (LPF) function with no wait states
Added a resolution-dulling function
Cleaned up with better comments

This project explains how to use thermistors to measure temperature, using the
Arduino platform.  

The method shown executes quickly, using a lookup table
with interpolation for greater precision.

The thermistor used in this example is a 
3950 NTC,  10K @ 25 Deg Celsius

Product ID 372
available from:
ADAFRUIT INDUSTRIES

103_3950_lookuptable.pdf:  Resistance/Temperature chart provided by mfr.
README:  This file
ThermistorCircuit.pdf:  Printout of annotated schematic (KiCad)

Spreadsheets:
A Helper Spreadsheet was created for generating the ADC lookup table
used in the Arduino sketch.  Also included are some x-y plots showing the
Resistance and ADC values versus temperature.  You have also the ability to change
the value of the reference resistor, as well as the excitation and reference voltages
Two versions have been provided:

ThermistorSpreadsheet.xls:  Microsoft Excel format (old)
ThermistorSpreadsheet.ods:  OpenDocuments spreadsheet format
